## Issue #1: Debug Logging Always Enabled in Production ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Status:** ✅ FIXED in PR

**Impact:** High - Affects production performance

**Files Affected:**
- `src/App.tsx` (line 11)
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` (line 18)
- `src/utils/tabVisibilityHandler.ts` (line 9)

**Description:**

All three files have debug logging flags hardcoded to `true`, causing extensive console.log calls to execute in production builds:

```typescript
// Current (problematic)
const DEBUG_APP = true;
const DEBUG_DASHBOARD = true;
const DEBUG_TAB_VISIBILITY = true;
```

This results in:
- Console.log overhead in production
- Increased memory usage from log message generation
- Potential exposure of internal application state in browser console
- Bundle size includes all logging code

**Recommendation:** Use Vite's built-in environment detection (`import.meta.env.DEV`) to enable logging only in development mode. The Vite bundler will tree-shake out all debug code in production builds.

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
const DEBUG_APP = import.meta.env.DEV;
const DEBUG_DASHBOARD = import.meta.env.DEV;
const DEBUG_TAB_VISIBILITY = import.meta.env.DEV;
```

**Estimated Performance Improvement:** 5-10% reduction in runtime overhead, complete elimination of console.log calls in production.

## Issue #2: Double API Call Workaround ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Status:** 🔍 DOCUMENTED (Requires investigation)

**Impact:** Very High - Adds 2+ seconds to every update operation

**File Affected:**
- `src/hooks/useLineItemCrud.ts` (lines 146-183)

**Description:**

The `updateLineItem` function makes TWO identical PUT requests to the Act! CRM API with a mandatory 2-second delay between them:

```typescript
// First API call
await fetch(actApiUrl, {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: actHeaders,
  body: JSON.stringify(actUpdateData),
});

// Wait 2 seconds
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));

// Second identical API call
await fetch(actApiUrl, {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: actHeaders,
  body: JSON.stringify(actUpdateData),
});
```

**Comment in code:** "Act! API quirk: Need to call PUT twice with delay for pricing to work correctly"

**Impact Analysis:**
- Every line item update takes 2+ extra seconds
- Doubles the load on Act! CRM API
- Poor user experience during updates
- Scales linearly with number of updates

**Recommendation:** 
1. Investigate the root cause of the Act! API quirk with Act! CRM documentation/support
2. Explore alternative API endpoints or request formats that don't require double calls
3. If double calls are truly necessary, consider:
   - Batching multiple updates to minimize the impact
   - Running the second call asynchronously without blocking the UI
   - Implementing a queue system for background retry

**Priority:** High - This is the most impactful performance issue but requires careful investigation before modification.

## Issue #3: Redundant Outstanding Invoices Calculation

**Status:** 🔍 DOCUMENTED

**Impact:** Medium - Unnecessary computation on every dashboard metrics calculation

**File Affected:**
- `src/utils/dashboardCalculations.ts` (lines 134-141)

**Description:**

The `calculateDashboardMetrics` function calculates outstanding invoices twice:

```typescript
// Line 134: First calculation
const outstandingInvoices = getOutstandingInvoices(invoices);

// Lines 140-141: Second calculation (inside calculateBilledUnpaidAmount)
const billedUnpaidAmount = calculateBilledUnpaidAmount(invoices);
// ^ This function internally calls getOutstandingInvoices again
```

The `getOutstandingInvoices` function filters through all invoices to find those with status 'sent' and no payment date. This work is being done twice.

**Recommendation:**

Refactor `calculateBilledUnpaidAmount` to accept pre-calculated outstanding invoices:

```typescript
export function calculateDashboardMetrics(invoices: Invoice[], lineItems: LineItem[]) {
  const outstandingInvoices = getOutstandingInvoices(invoices);
  
  return {
    totalOutstanding: outstandingInvoices.reduce((sum, inv) => sum + inv.line_total, 0),
    billedUnpaidAmount: outstandingInvoices.reduce((sum, inv) => sum + inv.line_total, 0),
    billedUnpaidCount: outstandingInvoices.length,
    // ... other metrics
  };
}
```

**Estimated Performance Improvement:** Reduces computation time by ~50% for this calculation, more impactful with larger datasets.

## Issue #4: Multiple Filter Operations on Same Array

**Status:** 🔍 DOCUMENTED

**Impact:** Medium - Unnecessary array iterations

**File Affected:**
- `src/components/OpportunityCard.tsx` (lines 432-445)

**Description:**

The component filters through the `lineItems` array 8 separate times to calculate status counts and totals:

```typescript
// 4 filters for counts (lines 433-436)
const actualInvoiceStatusCounts = {
  draft: lineItems.filter(item => getEffectiveStatus(item) === 'draft').length,
  sent: lineItems.filter(item => getEffectiveStatus(item) === 'sent').length,
  paid: lineItems.filter(item => getEffectiveStatus(item) === 'paid').length,
  overdue: lineItems.filter(item => getEffectiveStatus(item) === 'overdue').length,
};

// 4 more filters for totals (lines 441-444)
const statusTotals = {
  draft: lineItems.filter(item => getEffectiveStatus(item) === 'draft').reduce(...),
  sent: lineItems.filter(item => getEffectiveStatus(item) === 'sent').reduce(...),
  paid: lineItems.filter(item => getEffectiveStatus(item) === 'paid').reduce(...),
  overdue: lineItems.filter(item => getEffectiveStatus(item) === 'overdue').reduce(...),
};
```

Each filter operation iterates through the entire array, and `getEffectiveStatus` is called multiple times per item.

**Recommendation:**

Combine into a single reduce operation:

```typescript
const { counts, totals } = lineItems.reduce((acc, item) => {
  const status = getEffectiveStatus(item);
  acc.counts[status]++;
  acc.totals[status] += item.unit_rate || 0;
  return acc;
}, {
  counts: { draft: 0, sent: 0, paid: 0, overdue: 0 },
  totals: { draft: 0, sent: 0, paid: 0, overdue: 0 }
});
```

**Estimated Performance Improvement:** ~85% reduction in iterations (8 passes → 1 pass), more impactful with larger line item counts.

## Issue #5: Complex useEffect Without Memoization

**Status:** 🔍 DOCUMENTED

**Impact:** Medium - Potential for unnecessary re-renders

**File Affected:**
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` (lines 192-248)

**Description:**

The filtering effect has 5 dependencies and performs complex operations without memoization:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  let filtered = opportunities;
  
  // Multiple filter operations
  if (searchFilter.trim()) { /* ... */ }
  if (clientFilter !== 'all') { /* ... */ }
  if (statusFilter !== 'all') { /* ... nested filtering with invoiceLineItems */ }
  
  setFilteredOpportunities(filtered);
}, [opportunities, searchFilter, statusFilter, clientFilter, invoiceLineItems]);
```

The expensive filtering logic runs every time any of the 5 dependencies change, even if the result would be the same.

**Recommendation:**

Use `useMemo` to memoize the filtered results:

```typescript
const filteredOpportunities = useMemo(() => {
  let filtered = opportunities;
  
  if (searchFilter.trim()) { /* ... */ }
  if (clientFilter !== 'all') { /* ... */ }
  if (statusFilter !== 'all') { /* ... */ }
  
  return filtered;
}, [opportunities, searchFilter, statusFilter, clientFilter, invoiceLineItems]);
```

Also consider memoizing intermediate calculations and breaking down the complex filtering logic into smaller, memoized functions.

**Estimated Performance Improvement:** Reduces unnecessary re-computations, particularly beneficial during rapid filter changes.

## Issue #6: Inefficient Batch Database Operations

**Status:** 🔍 DOCUMENTED

**Impact:** Medium-High - Scales poorly with number of invoices

**File Affected:**
- `src/pages/Invoices.tsx` (lines 281-390)

**Description:**

The `autoGenerateInvoiceNumbers` function processes invoices one at a time, making individual database UPDATE queries:

```typescript
for (const item of companyItems) {
  const invoiceNumber = generateDateBasedInvoiceNumber(...);
  
  // Individual UPDATE query per item
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('invoice_line_items')
    .update({ invoice_number: invoiceNumber })
    .eq('id', item.id);
}
```

For 100 invoices, this results in 100 separate database round-trips.

**Recommendation:**

Use Supabase's batch update capabilities or collect all updates and execute them together:

```typescript
// Collect all updates
const updates = companyItems.map(item => ({
  id: item.id,
  invoice_number: generateDateBasedInvoiceNumber(...)
}));

// Single batch update using upsert
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('invoice_line_items')
  .upsert(updates);
```

**Estimated Performance Improvement:** 90%+ reduction in database round-trips for bulk operations, scales linearly with invoice count.
