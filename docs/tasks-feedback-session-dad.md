- âœ… **COMPLETED**: JavaScript date rendering bug fixed (timezone issues resolved)
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Leading zero and manual entry bugs fixed
- ðŸ”„ **REMAINING**: Tasks 5.0-11.0 require implementation

### Key Technical Context

- All date operations should use utilities from `src/utils/dateUtils.ts` to avoid timezone bugs
- Invoice numbering now uses date-based format with sequential numbering for same dates
- InvoiceData interface includes `company_name?` and `opportunity_name?` fields
- PDF generation has 15% smaller fonts for better print layout
- Follow the process rules in `.cursor/process-task-list.mdc` - implement one sub-task at a time and ask for permission before proceeding

## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Fix Invoice Number Format to Date-Based System
  - [x] 1.1 Create utility function for generating WSU-MMDDYY-XX format invoice numbers
  - [x] 1.2 Implement logic to handle duplicate dates with sequential numbering (-01, -02, etc.)
  - [x] 1.3 Update all existing invoice line items with new numbering format
  - [x] 1.4 Modify invoice generation to use new numbering system
  - [x] 1.5 Add database migration to update existing records, if needed.

- [x] 2.0 Add Company and Opportunity Header to Invoice Template
  - [x] 2.1 Modify InvoiceTemplate component to fetch opportunity data including company name
  - [x] 2.2 Add styled header section above line items table
  - [x] 2.3 Display company name (from opportunity.company_name field) as first line
  - [x] 2.4 Display opportunity name/description as second line
  - [x] 2.5 Ensure header styling matches existing invoice template design

- [x] 3.0 Fix JavaScript Date Rendering Bug
  - [x] 3.1 Investigate date rendering issue where 9/6 displays as 9/5
  - [x] 3.2 Review all date input components and their value handling
  - [x] 3.3 Fix timezone or date parsing issues in date utilities
  - [x] 3.4 Test date rendering across all forms (manual line items, deliverable dates, etc.)
  - [x] 3.5 Ensure consistent date display format throughout application

- [x] 4.0 Fix Leading Zero and Manual Entry Bugs
  - [x] 4.1 Fix leading zero issue on manual line item creation ($02000 display bug)
  - [x] 4.2 Fix deliverable date bug when creating manual entries (you specify a date but when you submit, the date is stripped. It works when you edit the line item afterward. I think we might have something in place creating deliverable line itesm from the contact upload modal as null deliverable date. It should default to null but if a user adds one for a deliverable in the modal, it should respect it in the creation)
  - [x] 4.3 Fix billing details update hook from invoice page (the hook does not save the company billing information in the database. That only seems to work when saving billing details from the dashboard page. Look at how its implemented on dashboard and make sure the form submit is handled the same way from the invoice page)
  - [x] 4.5 Test all manual entry workflows for data integrity (user to test and confirm with you)
