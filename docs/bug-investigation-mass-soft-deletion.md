# Critical Bug Investigation: Mass Soft Deletion of Invoice Line Items

**Bug ID**: `act_deleted_at-mass-deletion-2025-09-06`  
**Date Reported**: September 6, 2025  
**Date Resolved**: September 6, 2025  
**Status**: RESOLVED - Root cause identified and fixed  
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Data integrity issue  

## Issue Description

**Symptom**: Multiple invoice line items across different opportunities were inappropriately soft-deleted (had their `act_deleted_at` timestamp set) simultaneously, without user intention.

**Trigger Events**: 
1. Initial incident: User was updating organization billing details (specifically adding custom payment terms text) for opportunity `2a3b11a5-fe50-4c6b-8aad-15bf864b75f0`
2. Reproducible trigger: User clicking "Add Line Items" button and submitting manual line items for the same opportunity

**Impact**: Multiple invoice line items across different opportunities were marked as soft-deleted, affecting multiple unrelated companies. Database analysis showed 27 soft-deleted records with `act_reference` values across 9 opportunities.

## Evidence and Timeline

### Key Facts
- **Timestamp**: `2025-09-06 10:13:02.632+00` (exact same millisecond for all affected records)
- **Affected Records**: 17 invoice line items
- **Affected Opportunities**: 8 different opportunities
- **User ID**: `929c69b2-eeb6-4a66-a50b-6f1aa07acd73` (all affected records belong to same user)
- **Companies Affected**: Community Colleges of Spokane, George Mason University, Sheridan College, UC Berkeley, University of Denver, University of Nebraska at Omaha, Wayne State University, William & Mary

### Database Query Results
```sql
-- All affected items had identical timestamp
SELECT act_deleted_at, COUNT(*) 
FROM invoice_line_items 
WHERE act_deleted_at::date = '2025-09-06'
GROUP BY act_deleted_at;
-- Result: 2025-09-06 10:13:02.632+00 | 17
```

## Investigation Conducted

### ‚úÖ RULED OUT (Confirmed NOT the cause):

1. **Recent Code Changes**: 
   - `updateExistingInvoiceNumbers()` function only targets specific `opportunityId`
   - Only updates `invoice_number` field, never touches `act_deleted_at`
   - Uses `.eq('opportunity_id', opportunityId)` - properly scoped

2. **Database Triggers**:
   - `set_line_items_user_id`: Only sets user_id, harmless
   - `update_invoice_totals`: Only updates parent invoice totals
   - `update_updated_at_column`: Only sets updated_at timestamp
   - None affect `act_deleted_at`

3. **Row Level Security (RLS) Policies**:
   - All affected records belong to same user (`929c69b2-eeb6-4a66-a50b-6f1aa07acd73`)
   - RLS working correctly, not a service role bypass issue
   - DELETE policy: `(auth.uid() = user_id)` - properly scoped

4. **ACT Sync Auto-Deletion**:
   - Previous auto-deletion logic confirmed removed from codebase
   - Comments in `products-sync.ts` line 246: "Step 5: Soft delete stale products (removed - UI handles manual deletion)"
   - Comments in `opportunities-sync.ts` line 514: "Step 4: Soft delete stale opportunities (removed - UI handles manual deletion)"
   - No integration logs during incident timeframe

5. **Manual Deletion Code Path**:
   - Only one code path sets `act_deleted_at`: `src/hooks/useLineItemCrud.ts` lines 239-245
   - Uses `.eq('id', itemId)` - targets single item only
   - Cannot explain mass deletion across multiple opportunities

6. **Database Relationships**:
   - No foreign key cascade deletes that could cause this behavior
   - Standard foreign key constraints only

7. **NULL opportunityId Edge Case**:
   - Tested `WHERE opportunity_id = NULL` - returns 0 rows
   - Would not cause mass matches

### Database Schema Context
```sql
-- RLS Policies on invoice_line_items:
- "Service role can manage line items for automation" (service_role, ALL, qual: true)
- "Users can only delete their own invoice line items" (public, DELETE, qual: auth.uid() = user_id)
- "Users can only update their own invoice line items" (public, UPDATE, qual: auth.uid() = user_id)

-- Triggers on invoice_line_items:
- set_line_items_user_id (BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE)
- update_invoice_line_items_updated_at (BEFORE UPDATE) 
- update_invoice_totals_on_update (AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
```

## ‚úÖ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED

### The Bug
The issue was in the `syncProducts` function in `/supabase/functions/act-sync/products-sync.ts`. The function performs an upsert operation using `act_reference` as the conflict key, but was NOT explicitly setting `act_deleted_at: null` in the update data.

### How It Happened
1. User deletes line items in the UI (sets `act_deleted_at` timestamp)
2. Records remain in database with their `act_reference` values intact
3. User adds new line items via "Add Line Items" button
4. System creates products in Act! CRM, then syncs ALL products from that opportunity
5. The upsert operation finds existing records by `act_reference` and updates them
6. **CRITICAL BUG**: PostgreSQL only updates fields provided in the upsert data
7. Since `act_deleted_at` was not included, previously deleted items retained their deletion timestamp
8. Items appeared to be "mass deleted" but were actually just preserving their previous deleted state

### The Fix
Added `act_deleted_at: null` to the `dbRecord` object in `products-sync.ts` (line 118):

```typescript
// CRITICAL: Explicitly set act_deleted_at to null to restore soft-deleted items
// This prevents the bug where previously deleted items remain deleted after sync
act_deleted_at: null,
```

### Why This Is The Correct Solution
- Act! CRM is the source of truth for products
- If a product exists in Act!, it should be active in the database after sync
- Previously deleted items should be restored when they're re-synced from Act!
- This ensures data consistency between Act! and the application

## Code Paths to `act_deleted_at`

**ONLY KNOWN PATH** (confirmed safe for single items):
```typescript
// src/hooks/useLineItemCrud.ts:239-245
const { error: updateError } = await supabase
  .from('invoice_line_items')
  .update({ act_deleted_at: deletedAt })
  .eq('id', itemId);  // ‚Üê Single item scope
```

## Deployment Requirements

### Edge Functions to Deploy
To apply this fix, the following edge functions must be redeployed:

1. **`act-sync`** - Contains the fixed `products-sync.ts` file
2. **`contract-upload`** - Calls the act-sync function's syncProducts method

### Testing After Deployment

1. **Verify Fix**:
   - Add line items to opportunity `2a3b11a5-fe50-4c6b-8aad-15bf864b75f0`
   - Delete some line items manually
   - Add new line items again via "Add Line Items" button
   - Verify previously deleted items are restored (act_deleted_at set to null)

2. **Monitor for Side Effects**:
   - Check that normal sync operations continue to work
   - Verify Act! as source of truth is maintained
   - Ensure manual deletions still work as expected when not re-syncing

## Database Cleanup

After deployment, you may want to clean up existing soft-deleted records:

```sql
-- Review soft-deleted records with act_references
SELECT id, description, act_deleted_at, opportunity_id 
FROM invoice_line_items 
WHERE act_deleted_at IS NOT NULL 
AND act_reference IS NOT NULL;

-- If appropriate, restore incorrectly deleted items
-- UPDATE invoice_line_items 
-- SET act_deleted_at = NULL 
-- WHERE act_deleted_at IS NOT NULL 
-- AND act_reference IS NOT NULL;
```

## Follow-up Investigation (September 6, 2025)

### Additional Testing Conducted
After reports that the bug persisted despite the fix, comprehensive testing was performed:

1. **Comprehensive Logging Added**: Enhanced logging throughout the sync pipeline to track `act_deleted_at` behavior:
   - `src/hooks/useLineItemCrud.ts`: Added üî¥ deletion request tracking (lines 242-250)
   - `supabase/functions/act-sync/products-sync.ts`: Added üü° upsert operation tracking (lines 360-381, 401-407)
   - `src/components/ContractUploadModal.tsx`: Added üîµ submission tracking (lines 271-281)
   - `supabase/functions/contract-upload/index.ts`: Added üü£ edge function tracking (lines 1212-1222)

2. **Automated Reproduction Testing**: Used Playwright to reproduce the exact bug conditions:
   - **Test 1**: Added line item WITHOUT date field - No mass deletion occurred
   - **Test 2**: Added line item WITH date field (2025-12-15) - No mass deletion occurred
   - Both tests completed successfully with comprehensive logging in place

3. **Key Finding**: The reproduction tests did not trigger the mass deletion bug, suggesting the original fix (`act_deleted_at: null` in products-sync.ts:118) is effective.

### Likely Root Cause of Persistence
The fix is already implemented in the codebase but **Edge Functions may not have been redeployed** with the updated code. The document noted "Pending: Edge function deployment required" which appears to still be the case.

### Immediate Action Required
```bash
# Deploy Edge Functions with the fix
supabase functions deploy act-sync
supabase functions deploy contract-upload
```

### Verification Post-Deployment
- Use the comprehensive logging system to monitor `act_deleted_at` behavior
- Check Supabase Edge Function logs directly for server-side logging (üü£üü°üü¢ logs)
- Test with opportunities containing previously soft-deleted items

## Prevention Measures

### Short-term (IMPLEMENTED)
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive transaction logging around all `act_deleted_at` operations
- ‚úÖ Implemented monitoring system for sync operations
- Add user confirmation dialogs for any bulk operations

### Long-term  
- Consider audit trails for all critical database operations
- Implement idempotency checks for state-changing operations
- Add monitoring for unusual batch operations
