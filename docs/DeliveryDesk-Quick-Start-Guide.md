## Getting Started: Core Workflow

### 1. Manage Opportunities in ACT!
Continue using ACT! exactly as you do today at the opportunity level:
- Create new opportunities
- Update opportunity status 
- Manage opportunity details

### 2. Sync Data to DeliveryDesk
Click the **"Sync Act!"** button on the DeliveryDesk dashboard to pull your latest ACT! opportunity data. Do this whenever you make changes in ACT! that need to be reflected immediately.

### 3. Add Line Items to Opportunities
For each opportunity, add your deliverables and retainers using one of two methods:

**Option A: Contract Upload**
- Upload your contract PDF (must include cost proposal and pricing information)
- DeliveryDesk will automatically detect retainers vs deliverables
- Review the extracted line items to ensure accuracy
- Confirm to create the line items

**Option B: Manual Entry**
- Manually add each line item with details like name, amount, and type
- Review before finalizing

### 4. Configure Billing Information
Set up billing details once per opportunity:
- Organization and billing contact information
- Payment terms (default: Net 30)
- Custom client shortcode for invoice naming
- Optional custom payment terms text

The dashboard clearly shows which opportunities need billing information configured.

### 5. Set Billing Dates & Generate Invoices
- For deliverables without known billing dates, the dashboard will flag them
- Edit line items to add billing dates as they become clear
- **Invoices generate automatically** when: billing info is configured + line item has a billing date

### 6. Manage Invoices
- Preview invoices before sending
- Download PDF invoices with standardized file names
- Mark invoices as "sent" when delivered to clients
- Mark invoices as "paid" when payment is received
- Filter and view overdue invoices

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does ACT! integration work?
**In ACT!:** Continue managing opportunities exactly as you do today. DeliveryDesk only shows active opportunities - closed opportunities are automatically removed the next time you sync.

**In DeliveryDesk:** Use the "Sync Act!" button on the dashboard whenever you make changes in ACT! (like creating new opportunities or changing status to closed) that need to be reflected immediately.

### What should I manage in ACT! vs DeliveryDesk?
**ACT!:** Continue managing opportunity-level records and status as you always have.

**DeliveryDesk:** Use as your source of truth for all product and line item management. While products sync between both tools, it's strongly recommended to make all product changes (editing text, adjusting dates, changing amounts) in DeliveryDesk to keep everything properly synchronized.

### When do invoices get created?
Invoices generate automatically when two conditions are met:
1. The opportunity has billing information configured
2. A line item has a billing date set

You don't need to manually create invoices - just ensure these conditions are met and they'll appear for you to review and send.

### What do I need to do after an invoice is created?
1. **Review & Preview:** Check the invoice details and preview before sending
2. **Download:** Get the PDF with standardized naming for your records  
3. **Mark as Sent:** Update the status when you deliver it to your client
4. **Mark as Paid:** Update when payment is received

The tool automatically tracks overdue invoices based on your payment terms and sent dates.

### What if I need to make changes to line items?
Always make changes in DeliveryDesk rather than ACT! to ensure both systems stay synchronized. You can edit, delete, or adjust any line item details including descriptions, amounts, and billing dates.

### How often should I sync with ACT!?
Sync whenever you make changes in ACT! that need to be immediately reflected in DeliveryDesk, such as:
- Creating new opportunities
- Moving active opportunities to closed status
- Any other opportunity-level changes

The sync process is quick and ensures your DeliveryDesk data stays current.
